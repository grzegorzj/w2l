The best way to create complicated geometry is to create Container with \"direction: 'freeform'\" and auto width and height, and add an object to the center of it, and later position all objects relatively to our new object.\n\n```javascript\nconst centerCircle = new Circle({\n  radius: 60,\n  style: {\n    fill: \"#e74c3c\",\n    stroke: \"#c0392b\",\n    strokeWidth: 3,\n  },\n});\n\ncenterCircle.position({\n  relativeFrom: centerCircle.center,\n  relativeTo: container.contentBox.center,\n  x: 0,\n  y: 0,\n  boxReference: \"contentBox\",\n});\n\ncontainer.addElement(centerCircle);\n```\n\nThis way, we don't need to worry about what happens to the container - it's automatically sized.\n\n# Adjacence\n\nYou can intuitively move things along lines and in relation to points without doing complex computation. This is the mandated way of creating things with w2l.\n\nBelow, a way of constructing a Pythagorean theorem visualisation without calculating position of any of the object - this way, you know that the squares have adjacent sides with triangle.\n\n```javvascript\n// Create a 3-4-5 right triangle (classic Pythagorean triple)\nconst triangle = new Triangle({\n  type: \"right\",\n  a: 120, // Base = 3 units\n  b: 90, // Height = 4 units\n  // Hypotenuse will be 5 units (150px)\n  orientation: \"bottomLeft\",\n  style: {\n    fill: \"#34495e\",\n    stroke: \"#ecf0f1\",\n    strokeWidth: 3,\n  },\n});\n\ntriangle.position({\n  relativeFrom: triangle.center,\n  relativeTo: container.contentBox.center,\n  x: 0,\n  y: 0,\n  boxReference: \"contentBox\",\n});\n\ncontainer.addElement(triangle);\n\n// Get the three sides\nconst sides = triangle.sides;\nconst colors = [\"#e74c3c\", \"#3498db\", \"#2ecc71\"]; // Red, Blue, Green\n\n// Place a square on each side\nconst squares = [];\nsides.forEach((side, index) => {\n  const square = new Rect({\n    width: side.length,\n    height: side.length,\n    style: {\n      fill: colors[index],\n      fillOpacity: 0.7,\n      stroke: colors[index],\n      strokeWidth: 2,\n    },\n  });\n\n  // Position square at the center of the side\n  square.position({\n    relativeFrom: square.center,\n    relativeTo: side.center,\n    x: 0,\n    y: 0,\n    boxReference: \"contentBox\",\n  });\n\n  // Rotate to align with the side\n  square.rotate(side.angle);\n\n  // Move it outward along the normal\n  square.translate(side.outwardNormal, side.length / 2);\n\n  // Add square to container\n  container.addElement(square);\n  squares.push(square);\n});\n```\n\nIf you would like to identify which side of the .sides is adjacent, you can figure it out simply by knowing they're always drawn counter-clockwise.\n\nDrawing something next to it is also relatively trivial as we can use our side.center, etc.. positioning accessors.\n\n# Marking angles, altitudes\n\nAll geometrical figures expose methods that allow for annotating them with mathematical information such as angles, etc.\n\n```javascript\nsquare.showAngles({\n  rightAngleMarker: \"square\",\n});\n```\n\nUse those methods over any other approach.\n\n# Labels\n\nEach of the figures exposes an auto-labelling method. If you need them for a mathematical context, use it.\n\n\n"
