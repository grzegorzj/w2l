# Prompt

Given the existing library setup (have a look at 1-SCAFFOLDING), I want to grow the library.
There are two things I want to focus on right now: layout and positioning.

Let's create new folder in our library (layout) that will be taking care of the following concepts

- auto layouts of all forms:
  - columns
  - repeated relationships (e.g. 20 dots that have to be anchored to one another with a margin)
  - etc.
