time for new data visualisation components:

- alluvial diagram
- butterfly chart (this is very similar to bar charts we already have, perhaps you should reuse parts of it as its definitely something that should fall into the abstraction we have

remember to use theming abilityies; im not talking only about the SVG "style" ability, but to include the default theming and refer it to theme that's currently exposed through artboad.
